## 2024-05-23 - Missing Skip-to-Content Link
**Learning:** The application lacks a "Skip to Content" link, which is a critical accessibility violation (WCAG 2.4.1). Without it, keyboard users must navigate through the entire sidebar menu (which is quite long) to reach the main content on every page.
**Action:** Always verify the presence of a skip link in the main layout wrapper. It should be the first focusable element.
